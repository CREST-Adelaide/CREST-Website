AI has been used in medical applications, security applications, cloud computing, smart cities, web, and in many other domains. Pakistan is moving towards digitalization and the emphasis is on using technology to enhance productivity, economic stability, security and reachability. In this shift towards digitalization, cybersecurity cannot be neglected. AI is helping to achieve cybersecurity by detecting anomalies, adapting security parameters based on ongoing cyber-attacks, and to combat cyber-adversaries. However, AI systems can be controlled, compromised, biased, and misled through flawed learning models and poisonous input data. Therefore, AI systems need robust security. One should know how to use AI models securely? How to safeguard AI models from malicious inputs? How to not make adversaries take advantage of your smart moves? The integration of cybersecurity and AI can boost progress through secure, smooth and smart shift towards digitalization."}</Heading>
