# Tools and Automation Support for DLT System Engineering

This area of research concerns with the development, cataloguing, and evaluation of tools and automations to support engineering of DLT systems. Topics of interest include:

- Design and development of platforms for rapid prototyping of DLT networks
- Development of model-driven approaches to DLT system engineering
- Development of data-driven recommendation mechanisms for DLT system design
