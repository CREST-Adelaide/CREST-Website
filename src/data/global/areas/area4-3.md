# Tools and Techniques for Secure-by-Design DLT System

The third area of research concerns with techniques and tools for facilitating secure-by-design of DLT. We focus on a holistic perspective that considers not just the ledger networks but the interfaces between the ledger and other system components. Some topics of interest include:

- Establishing a security framework for the interface between ledger and the rest of the system
- Assessing the security of multi-ledger architecture
- Assessing the trade-off between security and privacy in a DLT system.
