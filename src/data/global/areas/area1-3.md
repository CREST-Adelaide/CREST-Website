# Security, Architecture and Platforms for Distributed Autonomous Systems

In this area of research, we devise and implement (i) security protocols for distributed architectures and platforms for autonous systems, (ii) data and information fusion for autonomous systems, (iii) task distribution/allocation algorithms and frameworks for distributed autonomous systems, and (iv) ontogloies and data structurs for storing and semantically relating information from multiple sources.
