# Security, Architecture and Platforms for Distributed Autonomous Systems

In this area of research, we devise and implement (i) security protocols for distributed architectures and platforms for autonous systems, (ii) data and information fusion for autonomous systems, (iii) task distribution/allocation algorithms and frameworks for distributed autonomous systems, and (iv) ontogloies and data structurs for storing and semantically relating information from multiple sources.

Below are links to some of our security work demonstrations on autonomous robots.

Following video link shows navigation of the bots. The demonstration shows first bot moving through a navigation path and share the details with a second robot. The second robot then reaches starting point of the first robot and then navigates though the same path.
