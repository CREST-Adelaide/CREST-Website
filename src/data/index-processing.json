        "subtitle": "In the past decades, cybersecurity threats have been among the greatest challenges for social development resulting in financial loss, violation of privacy, damages to infrastructures, etc. Organizations, governments, and cyber practitioners tend to leverage state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technologies to analyse, prevent, and protect their data and services against cyber threats and attacks. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of security systems, cybersecurity researchers and practitioners have shown increasing interest in applying data mining methods to mitigate cyber risks in a wide range of security areas, such as malware detection and key player identification in an underground forum. To protect the cyber world, we need more effective and efficient algorithms and tools that are capable of automatically and intelligently analysing and classifying the massive amount of data in cybersecurity complex scenarios. This workshop will focus on empirical findings, methodological papers, and theoretical and conceptual insights related to data mining in the field of cybersecurity."
